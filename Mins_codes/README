Input files:
	1. Input file is an excel sheet.
		"SERCaMP_Library_Gene_List_with_mass_spec.xlsx" in present case.

Steps to run the script.

Steps:
1a. on Biowulf:
    getting an interactive node:
	sinteractive --constraint=gpuk80 --gres=lscratch:10,gpu:k80:1

1b. on Cragger:
    log into a K80 GPU node (currently gpu-0-4)

2. load singularity container:
	module load singularity/2.4.6-local

3. load tensorflow image file:
	singularity shell --nv /state/partition1/users/rkverma/tf-manual.simg

	manually set the CUDA devices tensorflow can see, using
    		export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES= 1 # any integer between 0 and 7 could be used if running code on cragger.
4. run tail_response_rnn.ipynb ipython notebook.
	ipython notebook contains several cells that needs xlrd or matplotlib modules to be installed in sigularity hence
	you need to block them.
